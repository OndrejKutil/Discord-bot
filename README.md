## Project Description

This project is a customizable Discord bot built using **Python** and the **Nextcord** framework. It features modular command architecture, dynamic prefix handling, and clean integration with Discord's modern slash commands.

---

## Goals of the Project

- Learn how to structure scalable and maintainable Python projects
- Gain experience with real-time APIs and event-driven programming
- Practice user input handling, error management, and bot security

---

## What Iâ€™ve Learned

This project helped me understand and apply the following concepts:

- **Asynchronous Programming:**  
  Learned to use Pythonâ€™s `asyncio` features to handle concurrent bot events and commands.

- **Object-Oriented Design:**  
  Applied OOP principles to structure commands as classes and promote code reuse.

- **API Integration & Event Handling:**  
  Worked with Discordâ€™s API events like `on_ready`, `on_message`, and custom user commands.

- **Version Control & Open Source Workflow:**  
  Practiced Git branching, commits, and working with open-source project structure.
